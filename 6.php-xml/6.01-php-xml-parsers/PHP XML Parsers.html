    <h1>PHP XML Parsers</h1>

    <h2>What is XML?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>XML language is a way to structure data for sharing across websites</li>
      <li>Several web technologies like RSS Feeds and Podcasts are written in XML</li>
      <li>XML is easy to create. It looks a lot like HTML, except that you make up your own tags</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is an XML Parser?</h2>
    <p>To read and update, create and manipulate an XML document, you will need an XML parser.</p>
    <p>In PHP there are two major types of XML parsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tree-Based Parsers</li>
      <li>Event-Based Parsers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tree-Based Parsers</h2>
    <p>Tree-based parsers holds the entire document in Memory and transforms the XML document into a Tree structure. It analyzes the whole document, and provides access to the Tree elements (DOM).</p>
    <p>This type of parser is a better option for smaller XML documents, but not for large XML document as it causes major performance issues.</p>
    <p>Example of tree-based parsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SimpleXML</li>
      <li>DOM</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Event-Based Parsers</h2>
    <p>Event-based parsers do not hold the entire document in Memory, instead, they read in one node at a time and allow you to interact with in real time. Once you move onto the next node, the old one is thrown away.</p>
    <p>This type of parser is well suited for large XML documents. It parses faster and consumes less memory.</p>
    <p>Example of event-based parsers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>XMLReader</li>
      <li>XML Expat Parser</li>
    </ul>
